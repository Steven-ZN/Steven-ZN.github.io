**Computer Science @ Kean University** (Expected May 2026)  
Research in Weakly Supervised Segmentation, Active Learning, and LLMs.  
Dean's Honor List • 3.91 GPA (2024-2025)

## About

I'm passionate about developing efficient learning algorithms that work with limited labeled data - a critical challenge in medical imaging. My research focuses on the intersection of **computer vision**, **weakly supervised learning**, and **healthcare AI applications**.

## Current Research

**NSF-Funded Research Assistant (June 2025–Present)**  
Developing advanced tumor segmentation algorithms targeting journal publication.

**First-Author Publication**  
"Segmenting What Matters: A Dual-Stage Active Learning Framework for Weakly Supervised Tumor Segmentation" - IEEE-BIBM 2025 (under review)

## Technical Skills

**Programming:** Python, Java, MATLAB, SQL, C++  
**ML/DL:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, OpenCV  
**Tools:** Git, Docker, Linux, CUDA, Jupyter

## Key Projects

**DSAL-Net** - Dual-stage active learning for tumor segmentation ([GitHub](https://github.com/Steven-ZN/DSAL-Net))  
**Medfusion** - Medical image generation with VAE + Diffusion ([GitHub](https://github.com/Steven-ZN/Medfusion_Fake_Image))  
**MBTI-LLM** - Personality-controlled text generation ([GitHub](https://github.com/Steven-ZN/MBTI-LLM))

## Experience

**Research Assistant, Kean University (Dec 2024–Present)**  
NSF-funded dual-stage active learning segmentation achieving 68.25% IoU and 79.39% DSC.

**Vision-AI Lab, Wenzhou-Kean University (Sep 2023–May 2024)**  
SPF-funded raw image denoising using Bayer pattern modeling.

**Computer Club VP (Jan 2024–Jun 2024)**  
Led initiatives increasing membership by 30% and organized technical workshops.
