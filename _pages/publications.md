## Journal Papers (Under Review)

**Segmenting What Matters: A Dual-Stage Active Learning Framework for Weakly Supervised Breast Ultrasound Segmentation**  
*N. Zhang*, et al.  
*IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering and Medical Imaging (IEEE-BIBM 2025)*  
**Status:** Under Review | **Role:** First Author

**Abstract:** We propose DSAL-Net, a novel dual-stage active learning framework that addresses the challenge of limited labeled data in medical image segmentation. Our approach combines Class Activation Mapping (CAM) filtering with HSV color space stabilization and Mean Teacher consistency regularization to achieve superior performance with minimal annotation effort.

**Key Contributions:**
- Novel dual-stage architecture combining weak supervision with active learning
- HSV stabilization technique for robust pseudo-label generation
- Mean Teacher consistency framework adapted for medical imaging
- Comprehensive evaluation on breast ultrasound datasets

## Research Impact

My work focuses on making AI more accessible for medical applications by reducing the annotation burden on healthcare professionals. The proposed DSAL-Net framework has shown promising results in reducing labeling costs by up to 60% while maintaining clinical-grade segmentation accuracy.

**Future Directions:**
- Extending active learning frameworks to 3D medical imaging
- Investigating cross-modal learning for multimodal medical data
- Developing explainable AI methods for clinical decision support
